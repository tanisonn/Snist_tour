step 1: the speech recognisation module should be installed into python so the 
code to get it is
pip install SpeechRecognition
this was provided by the official python documentation!!!
step 2: the text to speech conversion tool is also required in order to convey the output to the speaker here
from the official documentation we get the code as follows:
pip install pyttsx3
step 3: the python audio is drivers are to be loaded such that there may not be any audio drivers missing cases
as the project is based on linux this code may help not leading to erros:
sudo apt sudo apt install python3-pyaudio
or 
pip install PyAudio
